# amfe-flexible

[Classic edition (0.3.2)](https://github.com/amfe/lib-flexible/tree/master)

> 由于`viewport`单位得到众多浏览器的兼容，`lib-flexible`这个过渡方案已经可以放弃使用，不管是现在的版本还是以前的版本，都存有一定的问题。建议大家开始使用`viewport`来替代此方案。
## Usage

#### Install

`npm i -S amfe-flexible`

#### Import

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
<script src="./node_modules/amfe-flexible/index.js"></script>
```

You can inline this file with [inline-source](https://npmjs.org/package/inline-source).

#### Develop

Use [postcss-adaptive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-adaptive).
